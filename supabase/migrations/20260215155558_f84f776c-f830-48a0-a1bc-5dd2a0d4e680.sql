('sba-7(a)-module-5-beginner', 'SBA 7(a) Financial Analysis Deep Dive', '<h2>Analyzing Borrower Financials for SBA 7(a) Loans</h2><p>Financial analysis is the cornerstone of SBA 7(a) underwriting. This article provides a systematic approach to evaluating borrower financial statements, calculating key ratios, and identifying red flags that impact credit decisions.</p><h3>Income Statement Analysis</h3><p>Start with revenue trends over 3 years—look for consistency and growth. Evaluate gross margins against industry benchmarks. Identify owner compensation adjustments, one-time expenses, and non-cash charges that distort true operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the foundation for cash flow lending.</p><h3>Balance Sheet Assessment</h3><p>Analyze working capital adequacy, leverage ratios, and asset quality. Current ratio above 1.2x and debt-to-equity under 3:1 are common SBA benchmarks. Look for contingent liabilities, off-balance-sheet debt, and related-party transactions that may not appear on the face of the statements.</p><h3>DSCR Calculation Methods</h3><p>SBA lenders use various DSCR methodologies. The most common adds back depreciation, amortization, interest, and owner compensation adjustments to net income, then divides by total debt service. A minimum DSCR of 1.15-1.25x is typically required, depending on the lender''s risk appetite.</p>', 1, true, 10, 'Technical Guide', 'Master financial analysis techniques for SBA 7(a) loan underwriting including DSCR calculations.'),

('sba-7(a)-module-6-beginner', 'SBA 7(a) Underwriting Best Practices', '<h2>Systematic SBA 7(a) Underwriting</h2><p>Effective SBA underwriting follows a structured methodology that evaluates character, capacity, capital, collateral, and conditions. This article outlines best practices for each underwriting pillar.</p><h3>Character Assessment</h3><p>Beyond credit scores, character assessment includes business experience evaluation, management capability analysis, and industry knowledge verification. SBA requires personal history statements and credit reports for all owners with 20%+ ownership.</p><h3>Capacity Analysis</h3><p>Capacity measures the borrower''s ability to repay from business cash flow. Projections must be reasonable and supported by historical performance, market data, and specific assumptions about revenue drivers, cost structures, and growth rates.</p><h3>Collateral and Conditions</h3><p>SBA requires lenders to collateralize loans to the maximum extent possible without declining otherwise creditworthy applications for insufficient collateral. Understanding how to value and perfect security interests in business assets, real estate, and personal guarantees is essential.</p>', 2, true, 9, 'Technical Guide', 'Learn systematic SBA 7(a) underwriting methodology covering character, capacity, capital, and collateral.'),

('sba-7(a)-module-7-beginner', 'SBA 7(a) Loan Closing and Servicing', '<h2>Post-Approval SBA 7(a) Loan Management</h2><p>Closing and servicing SBA 7(a) loans requires meticulous attention to documentation, compliance, and borrower relationship management throughout the loan lifecycle.</p><h3>Closing Documentation</h3><p>SBA 7(a) closings involve authorization-specific conditions, standard SBA forms, and lender-specific requirements. Key documents include the SBA Note, guaranty agreements, security agreements, and environmental indemnifications. Missing a single condition can delay or prevent SBA guaranty purchases.</p><h3>Post-Closing Compliance</h3><p>Lenders must maintain ongoing compliance with SBA requirements including annual reviews, financial reporting, site visits, and insurance monitoring. The SBA''s Purchase Review process examines lender compliance when guaranty purchases are requested, making documentation integrity critical.</p><h3>Problem Loan Management</h3><p>When borrowers face difficulties, lenders must follow SBA procedures for deferrals, modifications, and liquidations. Early intervention, proper documentation, and timely communication with the SBA protect the guaranty and maximize recovery.</p>', 3, true, 11, 'Technical Guide', 'Understand SBA 7(a) closing documentation, post-closing compliance, and problem loan management.'),

('commercial-real-estate-module-3-beginner', 'CRE Borrower Qualification Guide', '<h2>Qualifying Commercial Real Estate Borrowers</h2><p>CRE borrower qualification encompasses entity analysis, sponsor evaluation, and operating history assessment that together determine creditworthiness and appropriate loan structure.</p><h3>Sponsor Experience Evaluation</h3><p>Sponsor quality is the most important factor in CRE lending. Evaluate real estate portfolio size and performance, property management capabilities, financial reserves, and track record with similar property types. Inexperienced sponsors require stronger loan structures and lower leverage.</p><h3>Entity Structure Analysis</h3><p>CRE loans are typically made to single-purpose entities. Lenders must understand LLC operating agreements, partnership structures, trust arrangements, and corporate guarantees. Organizational charts and entity relationship maps reveal the true decision-making and guarantor structure.</p><h3>Operating History Requirements</h3><p>Stabilized properties should provide 2-3 years of operating statements. Value-add and transitional properties require pro forma analysis supported by market data, comparable properties, and renovation budgets. Understanding stabilization timelines is critical for loan structuring.</p>', 1, true, 10, 'Technical Guide', 'Learn CRE borrower qualification including sponsor evaluation and entity structure analysis.'),

('construction-loans-module-2-beginner', 'Construction Loan Products Overview', '<h2>Understanding Construction Financing Products</h2><p>Construction lending encompasses multiple product types designed for different project phases and risk profiles, from land acquisition through permanent financing.</p><h3>Land and Acquisition Loans</h3><p>Land loans fund the purchase of development sites before construction begins. These carry the highest risk in the construction lending spectrum due to limited collateral value and uncertain development timelines. Typical LTV ratios range from 50-65% for raw land and 65-75% for improved lots.</p><h3>Construction-to-Permanent Loans</h3><p>Single-close construction-to-permanent loans eliminate refinancing risk by automatically converting to permanent financing upon project completion. These are popular for owner-occupied commercial properties and provide certainty of takeout for both borrower and construction lender.</p><h3>Stand-Alone Construction Loans</h3><p>Stand-alone construction loans provide maximum flexibility but require separate permanent financing arrangements. These are common for speculative development and investor-driven projects where permanent financing terms may vary based on project performance at completion.</p>', 1, true, 9, 'Technical Guide', 'Overview of construction financing products including land loans, C-to-P, and stand-alone construction.'),

('equipment-financing-module-2-beginner', 'Equipment Finance Products and Structures', '<h2>Equipment Financing Product Types</h2><p>Equipment finance offers multiple structures beyond simple term loans, each designed to optimize specific borrower objectives including tax efficiency, cash flow management, and balance sheet presentation.</p><h3>Capital Leases vs. Operating Leases</h3><p>Capital leases (now called finance leases under ASC 842) transfer substantially all ownership benefits to the lessee and appear on the balance sheet. Operating leases provide use of equipment without ownership transfer, offering potential off-balance-sheet treatment under certain conditions.</p><h3>Equipment Lines of Credit</h3><p>Equipment lines of credit provide pre-approved borrowing capacity that borrowers can draw against as equipment needs arise. These are ideal for businesses with ongoing equipment acquisition programs, eliminating the need for separate applications for each purchase.</p><h3>Vendor Finance Programs</h3><p>Many equipment manufacturers partner with lenders to offer captive financing programs. These programs typically offer competitive rates, simplified documentation, and faster processing as marketing tools to support equipment sales.</p>', 1, true, 10, 'Technical Guide', 'Explore equipment finance product types including leases, lines of credit, and vendor programs.'),

('sba-504-module-1-beginner', 'SBA 504 Program Fundamentals', '<h2>Introduction to the SBA 504 Loan Program</h2><p>The SBA 504 program provides long-term, fixed-rate financing for major fixed assets through a unique partnership between conventional lenders, Certified Development Companies (CDCs), and small business borrowers.</p><h3>Program Structure</h3><p>The 504 structure splits financing three ways: a conventional lender provides up to 50% as a first mortgage, the CDC provides up to 40% through an SBA-backed debenture, and the borrower contributes as little as 10% equity. This structure reduces borrower equity requirements while providing low, fixed-rate financing on the CDC portion.</p><h3>Eligible Uses</h3><p>504 loans finance the purchase or construction of owner-occupied commercial real estate and major equipment with a useful life of 10+ years. Land and existing buildings, new construction, renovations, and long-lived equipment are all eligible. Working capital and inventory are not eligible.</p><h3>Borrower Benefits</h3><p>Key benefits include below-market fixed rates on the CDC portion (typically 10 or 20-year terms), low down payments, and the ability to finance project-related soft costs. The first mortgage lender benefits from a reduced LTV position, typically 50% or less.</p>', 1, true, 9, 'Beginner Guide', 'Introduction to the SBA 504 program structure, eligible uses, and borrower benefits.');
